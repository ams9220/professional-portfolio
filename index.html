            <p>
                I am currently a MBA Candidate at the University of Miami. 
                I am also a UM alum, having recently graduated with a Masters in Finance in Fall 2021. 
                I have spent the past few years learning about programming languages and coding, 
                inspired by both my undergraduate background in economics and my interest in fintech.
                I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to further develop those skills within a supportive environment 
                while also challenging myself to gain practical real-world experience.
